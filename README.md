This Notebook aims to compare different investment strategies using historical stock market data.

**Timing the Market** - Buying shares when shares are lowest every year
**Take Action** - Buying shares with all their money at the beginning of every year
**Dollar Cost Averaging** - Dividing up the money to buy shares at the beginning of every month
**Newbie** - Buys random amounts of stocks at random times.

By the end, we'll see which strategy is the best and which strategy is the worst, and how much of a difference there is among the strategies.
